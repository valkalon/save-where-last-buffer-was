# save-where-last-buffer-was

Allows you to save your new file in the folder from the previous file
you were using. Check the gifs below for a visual explanation.

This behavior is similar to the one used by Sublime Text.

This package overloads only your "ctrl-s" shortcut.

**Native atom behavior**

saving a new file opens the window from the root directory of the project
